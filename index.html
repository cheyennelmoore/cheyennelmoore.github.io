	<h1>Cheyenne Moore</h1>
	<h2>I'm a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolution Program of the Biology Department at <a href="https://www.biology.pitt.edu/">the University of Pittsburgh</a>. 
		I just started in the <a href="https://www.sarakuebbing.com/">Kuebbing Lab</a> where I study plant ecology and invasive species. </a></h2>
	<p>I'm a Pennsylvania native with a passion for natural history, particularly of my home state. I'm worked on projects focusing on deer herbivory,
		hemlock woolly adelgid, and most recently the PA rare plant <em>Baptisia australis<em> var. <em>australis<em>.
		Conservation is really important to me and I hope to one day work for a conservation or management agency.
